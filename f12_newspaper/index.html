      <p class="text">Although Fate of Atlantis followed in the tradition of post-Monkey Island games in that you can not reach a dead-end, it did retain the possibility of death scenarios for Indy as in Last Crusade.' Hal Barwood insisted on this because he felt that it wasn't an Indy adventure unless the character was in mortal danger, and reportedly he personally asked permission from Spielberg and Lucas in including this feature.<br><br>

In the early stages of this game's development, a rejected screenplay for the third Indiana Jones movie written by Chris Columbus (Gremlins, The Goonies) was considered for the basis of the game's plot. The notoriously weird script (which is available online) involved Indy traveling to Africa and meeting up with the Monkey King while attempted to recover magic peaches. Hal Barwood did not care for the screenplay anymore than Spielberg and Lucas did and thus decided to give the game an original story.<br><br>

Hal Barwood was a screenwriter, producer, and director as well as a mutual friend of Steve Spielberg and George Lucas before landing his job at Lucasfilm Games. One of his more famous contributions to film was his uncredited work on the script for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, in which he had a cameo appearance as one of the Flight 19 pilots.<br><br>

Noah Falstein, who was one of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's three project leaders, was initially unavailable to work on this game as he was leading an early version of The Dig. Other members of the game's team, such as William Eaken, Mike Stemmle, and Sean Clark, came off of another cancelled game - Forge, a sequel to Loom.<br><br>

Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein worked together for the first time on this game, and would go on to be become partners in future projects, such as the adventure game Mata Hari.<br><br>

Dark Horse adapted Fate of Atlantis into a comic which was loosely based on the script for the game. Ultimately release first, the comic features some elements that were dropped from the final game, such as Indy's travels to Cadiz, Spain.<br><br>

This game was the first "Talkie" LucasArts produced, and unlike future voiced LEC games, the feature was conceived after production had wrapped, and did not involve the game's original team. Doug Lee, the voice of Indy, would go on to reprise his role in Indiana Jones in the Infernal Machine. Nick Jameson, another voice actor in this game, would go on to do countless roles in LucasArts games (most famously Max in Sam & Max Hit the Road as well as in Double Fine's Psychonauts.)<br><br>

There are some interesting discrepancies between the text of dialog and the voiced version of the dialog, which you can find by turning both on.<br><br>

The floppy disk version of the game included a copy-protection, in which the player would have to correctly configured Atlantean keystones as indicated in the included sheet. The CD version did not include a copy-protection, because back then home CD-burners were nonexistent. This floppy/CD-ROM dual release trend would continue with the LEC adventures up to Sam & Max Hit the Road.<br><br>

Due to the cost of scanners at the time ($5000 a pop), the game was unable to take advantage of them for drawn backgrounds until very late during development. Monkey Island 2, which began its development later but was ultimately released earlier, was able to use these scanners for all of its backgrounds.<br><br>

The game contains over two hundred backgrounds, created by a team of three artists over the course of two years.<br><br>

The animation for Fate of Atlantis was accomplished using rotoscope technology, a first for the studio. Steve Purcell (as Indy) and his wife Collette Michaud (as Sophia) performed the characters' actions (such as whip-swinging or passionate kidding) in front of a camera, and the animators then drew over the recorded results.<br><br>

The game's box art was drawn by lead artist William Eaken, who was emulating the style of Drew Stuzan, the artist responsible for the Indiana Jones film posters.<br><br>

The character of Sophia Hapgood was invented for this game and she would later go on to appear in future video games as well as comics.<br><br>

The "I'm selling these fine leather jackets line" from Last Crusade is yet again referenced humorously in this game.<br><br>

If you have Indy look at the special cup that can hold the molten lava in Atlantis, he will say, "This is certainly NOT the cup of a carpenter."

If you wait long enough while in a pitch-black room, things will gradually become visible as Indy "adjusts his eyes" to the darkness.<br><br>

Having Indy look repeatedly look at the camel in Algiers will have him debate the animal's species and its spelling before finally just naming the camel, "George." The sentence line reflects all of the camel's name changes.<br><br>

On one of the shelves in Indy's office, one can find a Thuggee idol (a reference to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, as well as a meteor that Indy wishes would "quit glowing" – a reference to Maniac Mansion.<br><br>

In the game's resource files fans have found an unused location – a background screen for Sophia's office, adjacent to her apartment. The room featured Chuck the Plant, a prop that appears as an in-joke an other LucasArts adventure games, such as Maniac Mansion, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Day of the Tentacle.<br><br>

The game is one of LucasArts' most financially successful adventures, pushing a million units all told. This led LucasArts' to begin development on a graphic adventure sequel, entitled Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix, which was led by Joe Pinney (now a designer at Telltale Games). Although the game was well into development and some footage was actually showcased at a game trade show, it was cancelled for development problems (which included the clashing of artistic styles and problems of communication between LucasArts and an external developer which was creating many of the game's resources) as well as for the fact that the game's integral inclusion of Nazis in its plotline made it impossible (due to a new law) to sell in the ever important adventure market of Germany. After the project was scrapped, LucasArts attempted another graphic adventure sequel, titled Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny, which was cancelled in its earliest stages. Finally, LucasArts elected to make their next Indy game an action/adventure in the style of Tomb Raider in Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, once again headed by Hal Barwood. The stories for Iron Phoenix and Spear of Destiny were loosely adapted into Dark Horse comics, much like Fate of Atlantis was.<br><br>

One of the useless items Omar-Al-Jabbar can offer you is a baseball signed by Lou Gherigh, but when you actually look at the ball in your inventory, it's revealed to be signed by Ron Gilbert, creator of Monkey Island.<br><br>

If you wait a full fifteen minutes while Rolf is holding you at gunpoint at the Algiers dig site and never use your whip to snatch his gun, he will eventually kill you.<br><br>

In this game Indy teaches as Barnett College, which is the same school he taught at in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (both movie and game). In Raiders of the Lost Ark he taught at Marshall College (named after one of the film's producers Frank Marshall) and he's seen teaching there again in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. There's never been any official explanation given has to why he went from Marshall to Barnett, or from Barnett back to Marshall.<br><br>

The French street names in Monte Carlo translate into injokes. "Boulevard des Guerres des Etoiles" is "Star Wars Boulevard," and "Avenue des Troi Bois" is "Three Wood Avenue" (Threepwood?).<br><br>

Max of Steve Purcell's "Sam & Max" comic characters makes his cameo in this game as a form of a possible silhouette that Indy can make on the Monte Carlo hotel room wall with his flashlight.<br><br>

The LucasArts' logo is drawn on a few backgrounds in the game, such as on some rocks in the labyrinth.<br><br>

Monkey Island is references in several lines, such as "Look, a three-headed minotaur!" and Indy's line upon drowning beneath the sea.<br><br>

The maximum Current score for each of the paths are: Team Path: 635 IQ points, Wits Path: 641 IQ points, Fists Path: 624 IQ points.<br><br>

There's a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark at the dig site, if you look at the painting on the left wall.<br><br>

The line "I've got a bad feeling about this" is of course a direct reference to Star Wars. Interestingly enough, Indy would say the line again in the later made Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br><br>

On the central bookshelf in Indy's office, there is a stack of letters from the school principal to Indy's dad which all begin the same way: "Regarding Henry..." Regarding Henry was a 1991 movie starring Harrison Ford.<br><br>

A black bird statue can be found in Omar's house. If you look at it, Indy says "It's the stuff dreams are made of," the famous final quote from The Maltese Falcon.<br><br>

When you look at the strange markings in the middle circle of Atlantis and the strange markings next to the digging machine, Indy will reply "Atlantean graffiti." and "More Atlantean graffiti." This is of course a reference to George Lucas' film nostalgic 1950s teen film American Graffiti film and its sequel, More American Graffiti.<br><br>

On the message board in Caswell Hall, one of the messages is: "Edward Teller: Phone Home."<br><br>

In addition to these anachronistic references, mostly to Lucas or Spielberg releated projects, the game also features several references to literature and film contemporary to the 1930s time period throughout.<br><br></p>
