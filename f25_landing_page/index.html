				<h2>Kyokushin Spirit</h2>
				<h3>Kyokushin Spirit</h3>
				<p>"The heart of our karate is real fighting.<br>
				There can be no proof without real fighting.<br>
				Without proof there is no trust.<br>
				Without trust there is no respect.<br>
				This is a definition in the world of Martial Arts."</p>
				<h3>The Kyokushin Philosophy</h3>
				<p>Keep your head low (modesty), eyes high (ambition), mouth shut (serenity); base yourself on filial piety and benefit others.</p>
				<h3>Dojo Kun (Dojo Oath)</h3>
				<p>We will train our hearts and bodies for a firm unshaking spirit.<br>
				We will pursue the true meaning of the Martial Way, So that in time, our senses may be alert.<br>
				With true vigor, we will seek to cultivate a spirit of self denial.<br>
				We will observe the rules of courtesy, respect our superiors, and refrain from violence.<br>
				We will follow our god, and never foget the true virtue of humility.<br>
				We will look upwards to wisdom and strength, not seeking other desires.<br>
				All our lives, through the discipline of karate, we will seek to fulfill the true meaning of the kyokushin way.</p>
				<h3>The Eleven Mottoes of Mas Oyama</h3>
				<p>The Martial Way begins and ends with courtesy.<br>
				Therefore, be properly and genuinely courteous at all times.
				Following the Martial Way is like scaling a cliff - continue upwards without rest.<br>
				It demands absolute and unfaltering devotion to the task at hand.<br>
				Strive to seize the initiative in all things, all the time guarding against actions stemming from selfish animosity or thoughtlessness.<br>
				Even for the Martial Artist, the place of money cannot be ignored.
				Yet one should be careful never to become attached to it.<br>
				The Martial Way is centered in posture.<br>
				Strive to maintain correct posture at all times.<br>
				The Martial Way begins with one thousand days and is mastered after ten thousand days of training.<br>
				In the Martial Arts, introspection begets wisdom.<br>
				Always see contemplation on your action as an opportunity to improve.<br>
				The nature and purpose of the Martial Way is universal.<br>
				All selfish desires should be roasted in the tempering fires of hard training.<br>
				The Martial Arts begins with a point and end in a circle.
				Straight lines stem from this principle.<br>
				The true essence of the Martial Way can only be realized through experience.<br>
				Knowing this, learn never to fear its demands.<br>
				Always remember: In the Martial Arts the rewards of a confident and Grateful heart are truly abundant.</p>
